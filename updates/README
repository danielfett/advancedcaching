Here be updates.
================

When started, clients will search for updates in this directory on github.

Updates are stored in subdirectories of this directory, named after
the client's current version number. Clients will first search for a
file called updates, which is the output of md5sums for all the
updated files. Then, it will download these updated files and put them
in the user's directory (and use them from then on). See core.py for
details, also on live-reloading of modules.
